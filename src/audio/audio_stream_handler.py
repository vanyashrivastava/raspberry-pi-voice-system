# Owner: Oma
# Responsibility: Buffer audio frames, manage ring-buffers, and provide segmenting for inference.
# Goals:
# - Aggregate frames into time-aligned segments (e.g., 5s sliding window)
# - Support backpressure and queueing for downstream consumer threads
# Integration points:
# - Accept frames from `VoipAudioCapture` and local mic
# - Provide ready-to-infer segments to `detection.model_inference.inference_engine`
# Testing requirements:
# - Verify correct segmentation across frame boundaries and under high throughput

    Buffer and provide audio segments for inference pipelines.

        segment_seconds: float - length of segment to provide to inference (e.g., 5.0)

    TODOs:
        - Implement a ring buffer using numpy for efficient slicing
