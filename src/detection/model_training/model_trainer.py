# Owner: Jack
# Responsibility: Training scripts and utilities to fine-tune Hugging Face models for scam detection.
# Goals:
# - Provide training loops for text classification (email) and audio classification (transcribed text or audio features)
# - Save checkpoints with confidence calibration helpers
# Integration points:
# - Consumes datasets from `data_compiler`
# - Produces models used by `detection.model_inference.inference_engine`
# Testing requirements:
# - Unit tests for training step using tiny synthetic datasets and verifying convergence on toy task

import typing as t

# Dependencies: torch, transformers, sklearn, datasets
